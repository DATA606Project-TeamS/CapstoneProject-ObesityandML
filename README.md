## Project Introduction
Our project aims to analyze the relationship between obesity/overweight and different risk factors such as BMI, Race, Gender, physical activities, mental health, education level, and etc. <br/> 
Obesity constitutes a major public health concern in the U.S. and Globally. About 1 in 5 children and more than 1 in 3 adults struggle with obesity in the U.S. (CDC) Adults with obesity have higher risk for developing Heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer (CDC)
According to the The “World Health Organization” (WHO), 30% of global death will be caused by lifestyle diseases by 2030.
There is a limited number of studies using machine learning to analyze obesity/overweight related datasets in the U.S.<br/>

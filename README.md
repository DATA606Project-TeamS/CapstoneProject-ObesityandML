## Project Introduction
Our project aims to analyze the relationship between obesity/overweight and different risk factors such as BMI, Race, Gender, physical activities, mental health, education level, and etc. Obesity constitutes a major public health concern in the U.S. and Globally. About 1 in 5 children and more than 1 in 3 adults struggle with obesity in the U.S. (CDC) Adults with obesity have higher risk for developing Heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer (CDC) According to the The “World Health Organization” (WHO), 30% of global death will be caused by lifestyle diseases by 2030. From our research, there is a limited number of studies using machine learning to analyze obesity/overweight related datasets in the U.S. Hence, we have chosen to research on different risk factors related to obesity/overweight using data from the U.S.<br/>

## Research questions
1. Which variables are risk factors related to obesity/overweight?<br/>
2. What are the correlations between different risk factors and BMI?<br/>
    - Is mental health an important factor that correlates with obesity/overweight?<br/>
3. Which machine learning model can classify and conduct regression of the dataset?<br/>

## Approach
- Conduct EDA to find the relationship of different factors and produce visualizations. <br/>
- Find the most accurate model for our dataset. <br ?>
- Classification and Regression models (e.g Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees)<br/>
